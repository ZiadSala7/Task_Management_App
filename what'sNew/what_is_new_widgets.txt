Widgets:
    - SingleChildScrollView:
        - to remove the keyboard while scrolling :
            keyboardDismissBehavior: ScrollViewKeyboardDismissBehavior.onDrag,

    // because of the errors happens by setState
    // Calling setState() within the build() itself (or in a function called during the build process) is prohibited because Flutter is still building the widgets at that time.
    - WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
          onDateChanged(date);
        });
      },
    );
